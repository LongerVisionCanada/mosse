Filters
=======

These filters were trained on the [MUCT dataset](https://github.com/StephenMilborrow/muct). In order to run the code to train the filters, download the images from the MUCT dataset and insert them into a subfolder with name `data`. Note that to train your own filters on other datasets, you will have to customize the code, especially wrt coordinates and crop used.
